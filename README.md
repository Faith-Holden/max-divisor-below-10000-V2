# max-divisor-below-10000-V2

My Solution for Chapter 3 Exercise 6 of "Introduction to Programming Using Java"

Problem Description:
Exercise 3.2 asked you to find the number in the range 1 to 10000 that has the largest (solution)
number of divisors. You only had to print out one such number. Revise the program so
that it will print out all numbers that have the maximum number of divisors. Use an array
as follows: As you count the divisors for each number, store each count in an array. Then
at the end of the program, you can go through the array and print out all the numbers
that have the maximum count. The output from the program should look something like
this:
    Among integers between 1 and 10000,
    The maximum number of divisors was 64
    Numbers with that many divisors include:
        7560
        9240
